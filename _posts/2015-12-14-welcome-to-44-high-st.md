Welcome
to 44 High Street!

This
is our family home in West Wales. We love coming here to recharge our batteries
and spend time together as a family, at all times of the year! We hope you love
it as much as we do.

Please
use the visitor book and suggestions/comments book to let us know of any ideas
you have on how we can improve things for our guests.

If
you have any questions then please do contact Coastal Cottages on 01437 765 765
or

01437
767 600 in the first instance.

Over
the next few pages we have included some useful information on aspects of the
house and an A-Z of some of our favourite things to do in the area.

We
hope you have a fantastic time here!
